## Welcome

Welcome to the Suffolk chapter homepage!

We are a group of people with an interest in cyber secrity. Our aim is to bring together students, researchers, professionals and educators from academia and the public and private sectors in order to raise awareness and to educate about cyber security. We want to build a local community of like-minded people and to help promote and grow the local cyber security industry.

The chapter leaders are <a href="mailto:wojciech.cichon@owasp.org">Wojciech T Cichon</a>, 
<a href="mailto:david.flint@owasp.org">David Flint</a> and <a href="mailto:martin.russ@owasp.org">Martin Russ</a>.

## Our Goals

- Educate: To provide free talks from industry professionals, demonstrations of tools and techniques, and host other cyber security-related events
- Support: To support individuals wishing to enter the profession and to help grow the cyber security industry within Suffolk
- Community: To build a community and network where people can share knowledge, discuss issues, meet new people and help us to achieve our goals

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **Introduction and overview of the event**
  - **Capture the Flag**

OWASP Suffolk Chapter is proud to present a CTF event for 2021 in collaboration with OWASP Diversity and Inclusion Committee and many OWASP UK Chapters (including; Dorset, London, Bristol, Reading, Cambridge, Newcastle).

The CTF will be hosted by Security Innovation using their platform and will be instructor lead. It combines with Security Innovation's CMD+Ctrl Bootcamp and they are extending an offer to all participants for 4-weeks FREE access to the self-paced training courses.

Although the event is online, as this is a live participatory event it will not be recorded.

Want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities? Join Several OWASP UK Chapters and Security Innovation as members compete in CMD+CTRL, a web application cyber range where players exploit their way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today. Success means learning quickly that attack and defence is all about thinking on your feet.

For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is ideal for development teams to train and develop skills.

ATTENTION: Additional registration required in order to gain access to the CTF platform and play.
Event registration link will be shared nearer to the time

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Misconfigurations ##

### [2nd December 2021 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/282025399/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP updates**
  - **The talk**
  - **Open discussion**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) makes deploying cloud or container configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.

In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.
