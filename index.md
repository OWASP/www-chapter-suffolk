## Cyber Security - Thinking Like The Enemy - Peter Cochrane OBE ##

### [15th February 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283194340/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - Cyber Security: Thinking Like The Enemy**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

There is far more to cyber security than technology.

Every successful attack starts with human fallibility and failure.

The Dark Side is an integrated business venture on a global scale.

Operating as individually isolated organisations means we can only lose.

Integrating the information and resources across sectors and countries is essential.

The projected ‘business earnings of The Dark Side will be >5x the GDP of the UK by 2030.

## The best practices of working securely on AWS - Alex Kearns ##

### [22nd February 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283567353/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **Live demo of OWASP Juice Shop**

So you want to have a go at ethical hacking but you don't know where to start?

In under an hour Dave, Wojciech and Martin will walk you through installing, setting up and attacking OWASP Juice Shop from the comfort of your own home.

OWASP Juice Shop is a free insecure web application that you can install on your own computer. It's a popular security training tool riddled with security issues like SQL injection, XSS and security misconfigurations. Using gamification Juice Shop acts as an e-commerce website that you can legally attack on your own computer.

Juice Shop has built-in tutorials and comes with 100 challenges for you to find and exploit. With each challenge you solve your score increases on the scoreboard. But wait, where is the scoreboard? That's your very first challenge, to find the scoreboard hidden within the application. As you progress Juice Shop awards you points and displays your progress. Challenges are ranked by difficulty.

After walking you through installation and setup we will have an interactive session where we demo how to find the scoreboard and complete a few of the easy challenges.

### [29th March 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283317246/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - The best practices of working securely on AWS**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

Cloud has been around for a relatively long time now, yet there doesn’t seem to be a huge community of purely security focused individuals working with it. My theory is that this is down to cloud security appearing to be so different to what people are used to working with. Let’s try and bust that myth.

Join me for a bird’s eye view of the most important security concepts on AWS, what the best practices are around them as well as what AWS can do to help make life easier. I hope that this talk makes some of you more comfortable exploring AWS in the future.

About Alex:

Alex Kearns is a consultant at Inawisdom in Ipswich delivering data and AI/ML solutions on AWS for a variety of customers. Prior to this he has worked for an early stage startup and BT in a security focused role. He has a firm belief that security best practices should underpin all workloads, especially those in public clouds such as AWS.
