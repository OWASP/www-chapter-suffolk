## Welcome

Welcome to the Suffolk chapter homepage!

We are a group of people with an interest in Cyber Security. Our aim is to bring together students, researchers, professionals and educators from academia and the public and private sectors in order to raise awareness and to educate about Cyber Security. We want to build a local community of like-minded people and to help promote and grow the local Cyber Security industry.

The chapter leaders are <a href="mailto:wojciech.cichon@owasp.org">Wojciech T Cichon</a>, 
<a href="mailto:david.flint@owasp.org">David Flint</a> and <a href="mailto:martin.russ@owasp.org">Martin Russ</a>.

## Our Goals

- Educate: To provide free talks from industry professionals, demonstrations of tools and techniques, and host other cyber security-related events
- Support: To support individuals wishing to enter the profession and to help grow the cyber security industry within Suffolk
- Community: To build a community and network where people can share knowledge, discuss issues, meet new people and help us to achieve our goals

## What is eBPF and why should you care? - Kev Sheldrake ##

### [20th October 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/288875196/)

The Talk:

eBPF is relatively new and “a revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in an operating system kernel.” You can achieve similar results to writing a kernel module, but in a (supposedly – we’ll come to that) safe manner. eBPF code runs in a virtual machine and, depending on the program type, can access all sorts of kernel internals, with programs being launched when specified code points get hit.

I will talk about the basics and how to get up and running, the challenges and pitfalls to overcome, a library I wrote when working at Sysinternals to take away some of the pain, the Sysmon For Linux tool I wrote for Sysinternals that logs events to Syslog, and Cilium/Tetragon (and Cilium/ebpf library) that makes accessing eBPF for system observability easier. I will discuss technical details and explain the different use cases that might benefit you, from blue team using Sysmon and Cilium/Tetragon to achieve super powerful abilities, to researchers building custom program tracers, to red team exploiting kernel vulns, to sysadmins seeking performance issues.

It is a truly exciting thing that everyone is talking about.

Bio: Kev Sheldrake is a security software engineer and researcher who started working in the technical security field in 1997. Over the years, Kev has been a developer and systems administrator of ‘secure’ systems, an infosec policy consultant, a penetration tester, a reverse engineer and an entrepreneur who founded and ran his own security consulting company. He currently works at Isovalent on the open source and enterprise versions of the system observability tool Tetragon, and in the past he specialised in IoT, crypto, and tool development for a number of years.

## OWASP Suffolk Fight Club - October 2022 ##

### [25th October 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/288768650/)

Location: virtual

## Deepfakes: A Growing Cybersecurity Concern - Mike Warner ##

### [26th October 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-dorset-chapter/events/288904769/)

Location: virtual

The talk: 

Join us for a look at Deepfakes with Mike Warner, one of the OWASP Dorset Chapter Leads.

Deepfakes; an emergent type of threat falling under the greater and more pervasive umbrella of synthetic media, utilise a form of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to create believable, realistic videos, pictures, audio, and text of events which never happened.

Criminals are already starting to utilise deepfake technology to impersonate executives' voices on phone calls and even their likenesses over video to add an air of legitimacy to their attacks. As deepfakes become more lifelike, phone calls, video chats and other forms of communication will be more vulnerable to abuse.

This talk will look at the origins of Deepfake technology, how they work, the threats and ethical quandaries they pose, and potential mitigations, with a handful of demos.

This talk is hosted by OWASP Dorset and shared with OWASP Suffolk and Bristol.

## An Introduction to OSINT ##

### [22nd November 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/288747104/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **An Introduction to OSINT with Q&A**

OSINT - OpenSource INTelligence is the art of research and analysis of data that is freely available from publicly available sources. Combined with digital tools and techniques it's amazing what you can learn using nothing more than a computer and an internet connection.

This talk will:

- Introduce you to the world of OSINT
- Provide an overview of some of the techniques and resources used in OSINT
- Discuss how OSINT is being used today

Disclaimer: This talk is given for informative purposes only. Use of OSINT tools and techniques for illegal activities is not condoned by OWASP.
