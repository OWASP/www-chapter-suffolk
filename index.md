We are a group of people with an interest in cyber secrity. Our aim is to bring together students, researchers, professionals and educators from academia and the public and private sectors in order to raise awareness and to educate about cyber security.

  - **Introduction**
  - **The Eastern Cyber Resilience Centre - helping SMEs be cyber resilient by Detective Inspector Fiona Bail**

Cybercrime is a growing threat to businesses of all sizes, but small and medium enterprises may not have the resources or confidence to implement cyber resilience strategies. The ECRC has been set up to help those companies recognise the risk and mitigate it, through free membership, guidance and affordable services.

Join us for a review of the current cybercrime landscape, why the ECRC has been set up and some practical tips that companies can implement to help improve their cyber resilience.
