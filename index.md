## Next Meeting/Event(s)

##### OWASP Suffolk Chapter Meetup #####

### [24th March 2021 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/276874058/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **Introduction**
  - **Security for Managers - Martin Russ**
  - **Networking**
  
"Security For Managers"’ is intended as a wake-up call for people who assume that IT security doesn’t apply to them or their company. Think of it as a visit from a consultant who spends a lot of time with you, and then says: ‘This is what you need to do’, and then doesn’t charge you a penny!
