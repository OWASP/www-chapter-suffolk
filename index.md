We are a group of people with an interest in Cyber Security. Our aim is to bring together students, researchers, professionals and educators from academia and the public and private sectors in order to raise awareness and to educate about Cyber Security. We want to build a local community of like-minded people and to help promote and grow the local Cyber Security industry.

## Our Goals

- Educate: To provide free talks from industry professionals, demonstrations of tools and techniques, and host other cyber security-related events
- Support: To support individuals wishing to enter the profession and to help grow the cyber security industry within Suffolk
- Community: To build a community and network where people can share knowledge, discuss issues, meet new people and help us to achieve our goals

## Next Meeting/Event(s)

## The best practices of working securely on AWS - Alex Kearns ##

### [29th March 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283317246/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - The best practices of working securely on AWS**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

Cloud has been around for a relatively long time now, yet there doesn’t seem to be a huge community of purely security focused individuals working with it. My theory is that this is down to cloud security appearing to be so different to what people are used to working with. Let’s try and bust that myth.

Join me for a bird’s eye view of the most important security concepts on AWS, what the best practices are around them as well as what AWS can do to help make life easier. I hope that this talk makes some of you more comfortable exploring AWS in the future.

About Alex:

Alex Kearns is a consultant at Inawisdom in Ipswich delivering data and AI/ML solutions on AWS for a variety of customers. Prior to this he has worked for an early stage startup and BT in a security focused role. He has a firm belief that security best practices should underpin all workloads, especially those in public clouds such as AWS.

## All about Passwords ##

### [12th April 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/284467213/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **All about Passwords**
  - **Q&A**

Love them or hate them, passwords have become part of our daily life. We use them to sign into just about everything, from our devices to emails, social media, cloud services and digital banking. We have to remember different passwords for each site we need to log-in to, and we are forced to change them on occasion. It can be a lot to remember. Password Managers can help and 2FA or MFA can provide extra security. Yet despite all that, service providers can still be compromised and our carefully chosen passwords can end up somewhere on the darkweb being sold by the hundred thousand.

Making use of both slides and live demonstrations Martin and David will take you through a brief history of passwords, discussing password lengths and formats, password policies, guidelines and best practices, the storage and transmission of passwords, 2FA and MFA, and pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about passwords. All in under an hour.

Throughout the talk we will employ a Red vs Blue format with Martin playing Blue, discussing best practices and how to keep your logins protected. While David will be playing Red, discussing the techniques and tools employed by malicious actors in an attempt to secure access to your logins.

Disclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes.

## Are We Secure? - Jeff Williams ##

### [26th April 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/284899658/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - Are we Secure?**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

We all trust software with the most important aspects of our life… but it’s a blind trust with virtually no justification. Actually, by almost any measure, application security has been failing for 20 years. Software is still riddled with vulnerabilities and gets attacked thousands of times a month – mostly undetected. Yet instead of trying different approaches, we mostly keep pushing the same futile and expensive practices harder.

In this talk, we’ll discuss why the underlying asymmetric information problem in the software market makes it impossible to make progress. And we’ll talk about how we can escape this trap, change the software market, and make software trustworthy for everyone.
