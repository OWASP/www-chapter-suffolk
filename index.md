The Talk:

The log4j incident shocked the world back in December - but by implementing the proper protocols and tools early-on organizations can be better prepared moving forward. Logs, metrics, security, and metrics can be your secret weapon when it comes to the observability of your applications and software. But are you using all of your data sources to their full potential?

Weâ€™ll go over what organizations should keep in mind before, during, and post-security vulnerabilities (based on the log4j incident) when it comes to their monitoring tools and how powerful insights can be pulled to avoid delayed crisis management.
