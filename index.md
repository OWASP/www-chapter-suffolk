## Securing your Machine Learning solutions and protecting your models - Phil Basford ##

### [3rd May 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/285087125/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - Securing your Machine Learning solutions and protecting your models**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

Machine Learning is increasingly being used by companies as a disruptor or providing a USP. This means that Machine Learning models need to cope with being a critical part of solutions and if those solutions use PCI-DSS or PII then the models must be highly secure.

In addition, if a Machine Learning model is part of your USP then you will want to protect it. Also, the EU AI Regulation and UK AI Strategy means that AI is becoming increasingly regulated. This means you need able to prove what model made a prediction and why it made it by providing auditability and explainabilty.

In this talk we go over these issues and how to address them including using AWS and how to implement development best practices.

The Talk:

The log4j incident shocked the world back in December - but by implementing the proper protocols and tools early-on organizations can be better prepared moving forward. Logs, metrics, security, and metrics can be your secret weapon when it comes to the observability of your applications and software. But are you using all of your data sources to their full potential?

We’ll go over what organizations should keep in mind before, during, and post-security vulnerabilities (based on the log4j incident) when it comes to their monitoring tools and how powerful insights can be pulled to avoid delayed crisis management.
