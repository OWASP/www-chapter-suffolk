## Welcome

Welcome to the Suffolk chapter homepage!

We are a group of people with an interest in Cyber Security. Our aim is to bring together students, researchers, professionals and educators from academia and the public and private sectors in order to raise awareness and to educate about Cyber Security. We want to build a local community of like-minded people and to help promote and grow the local Cyber Security industry.

The chapter leaders are <a href="mailto:wojciech.cichon@owasp.org">Wojciech T Cichon</a>, 
<a href="mailto:david.flint@owasp.org">David Flint</a> and <a href="mailto:martin.russ@owasp.org">Martin Russ</a>.

## Our Goals

- Educate: To provide free talks from industry professionals, demonstrations of tools and techniques, and host other cyber security-related events
- Support: To support individuals wishing to enter the profession and to help grow the cyber security industry within Suffolk
- Community: To build a community and network where people can share knowledge, discuss issues, meet new people and help us to achieve our goals

## Thinking like a Hacker ##

### [21st March 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291864159/)

Location: virtual

Over the past few years OWASP Suffolk has been bringing you free events to show you cyber security best practices. We discussed creating strong passwords, patching and backing up, OSINT, API Security, SCA and RASP, and many other subjects. In this event we hope to cement that knowledge by showing you the view from the other side of the fence.

In this live interactive demonstration we will show you what a web target looks like from the perspective of an attacker. With the use of a vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been done to mitigate each step of the attack.

By thinking like a Hacker and seeing your "defences" from their point of view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best practices really is.

Attendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created for the purpose of learning.

## OWASP Suffolk Fight Club - April 2023 ##

### [11th April 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291864839/)

Location: virtual

No agenda, no slides, no recording, 100% unscripted.

Practical learning: Live ethical hacking challenges, workshops, CTFs and sharing of knowledge.

## ZAP and Burp Walkthrough ##

### [25th April 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291848350/)

Location: virtual

For the past two years I've been using OWASP ZAP and PortSwigger's Burp Suite (Community Edition), switching between the two as I learned hacking techniques and took part in CTFs. Each has their own pros and cons, features I like, quirks, and even room for improvement.

For this event we will be taking a slow walk through the interfaces and features of both tools side-by-side with both pointed at a vulnerable target.

This will be an interactive session where you can ask questions throughout. This event is aimed at the beginner who wishes to know more about these two popular tools. This is an unbiased demonstration and both tools will be in an out-of-the-box state with no optional extras / add-ons / plugins installed.

## OWASP Suffolk Fight Club - May 2023 ##

### [9th May 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291864867/)

Location: virtual

No agenda, no slides, no recording, 100% unscripted.

Practical learning: Live ethical hacking challenges, workshops, CTFs and sharing of knowledge.

## Injection Vulnerabilities ##

### [23rd May 2023 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-suffolk-chapter/events/291863605/)

Location: virtual

Injection vulnerabilities remain a common problem today. A single mistake could expose your whole database and customer data or give an attacker the ability to remotely execute code on your server.

We will look at some examples of coding mistakes that can lead to injection vulnerabilities and discuss how they could be mitigated.

This is a joint event provided by OWASP Bristol and OWASP Suffolk.
