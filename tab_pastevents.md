#### Panelists:

- **Jason Sewell**

Jason has over 15 years of experience as a web application and systems developer, in addition to over ten years in DevOps and systems architecture related roles. Jason began his journey into information security through necessity as he built skills and knowledge through his roles in leading internal initiatives for securing application and cloud infrastructure. After years of blue team and developer/devops roles, his interests centre around offensive security and wanting to help organizations actively find problems rather than just follow best practices and hope for the best.

- **Cayce Mahon**

Has over nine years of experience in Information Security. Originally graduating with an AFA in fine art , she took a unique path of education in regards to her transition into information security. Through persistence and self-study, she was able to obtain a Security+ and OSCP certification on her own. While at OccamSec, she has led and has been a part of a variety of offensive engagements in the realms of cyber and physical security (security/penetration testing of applications, network/physical infrastructure and systems) as well as risk assessment (architecture/policy review, vulnerability assessment, and employee interviews). Finding crucial fault points in an organization’s infrastructure while also adapting to the ever changing demands of the clients she works with.

- **Ivano Bianco**

Italian, with a fake Russian accent. Started using computers at the tender age of 11, by the age of 14 he switched from the BASIC language to Assembly and started to circumvent copy protections for fun. Spent the next 20 years working in IT Operations, keeping systems secure and automating deployments before job titles like "IT Security Engineer" and "DevOps Engineer" were a thing.

Had the opportunity to cover technical hands-on roles for a multitude of SME and multinational companies such as: - Société Générale - H3G - Ericsson - Global Payments – Puppet.

Nowadays he prefers to focus on penetration testing, web application testing (because breaking things is always fun), threat hunting and security awareness training. He still likes to figure out why a server is down, but will not fix your computer.

- **Nicholas Donarski**

Has been a pioneer in the Information Security field for over 20 years. During this time, he’s worked with a diverse client list which includes multinational and global organizations, Federal, State and Local government, and enterprises of all sizes. He is recognized in the international community as a senior authority on PenTesting strategy, operations, tools and training. Over the years, he’s continued to expand his experience in security to include network security, mobile, web, and application security, compliance, high threat physical security and RedTeam Operations. Recently, he’s focused on the development of security architecture and development around machine learning and Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI).

  - **Living In A World of Zero Trust - Vandana Verma**  \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Hs7JPRjgg) \]
    
    As now everything is moving to cloud, all the applications are accessible from anywhere and everywhere. However, No one wants their private information to be compromised and openly available for the world. We have been taking so many precautions, however breaches continue to happen. How should we fix this?

    Organisations have been talking about Zero Trust lately and this has become a buzzword. The talk will explore Zero Trust beyond the buzzword and describe what exactly is Zero Trust and why it is so important to keep organisations safe. How can we implement or deploy Zero Trust in an organisation while keeping the current and future state of an organization in mind. What should be the business model to move any organisation towards Zero Trust Architecture and what all policies need to be implemented to achieve the same.
  #### Speakers

  - **how to prevent Dev from committing secrets and credentials into git repositories - Abhinav Sejpal** \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESGZ_Di7CtM) \]
    
    Sensitive information such as the AWS keys, access tokens, SSH keys etc. are often erroneously leaked via the public source code repositories due to accidental git commits. This can be avoided by using pre-commit hooks like “Talisman” which checks for sensitive information in the files before commits or push activity.

### [4 November 2019 (Ipswich)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/265681990/)

Location:   University of Suffolk, Waterfront Building, 19 Neptune Quay,

    Suffolk Chapter Leader.
 
  - **Practical Threat Analysis – Martin Russ** \[
    [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/practical-threat-analysis-martin-russ)
    \]\[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lI4ZJom3u0) \]
 
     Martin Russ shows you how to actually do Threat Analysis using a
    simple spreadsheet as a guide. The key to successful threat analysis
    and modelling is to have a clear idea of how to get to the
    end-point, and not to get overwhelmed with how you are going to get
    there\! Having a simple guide makes this much easier, but there
    aren’t many examples out there - this turns to be one of those
    rare topics where Google searches don’t return much that is
    particularly useful. So we will be using a very straight-forward
    approach that isn’t scary or hard to understand, and which doesn’t
    require a brain the size of a planet. or the services of an
    expensive consultant\!

#### Speakers

  - Martin Russ passed the CISSP exam in just over four hours (you are
    allowed to take six\!), but has just lapsed and returned to the
    status of mere mortal. He worked in the Security Engineering
    department of a major US utility metering company for nearly ten
    years, and knows too much about hacking devices that measure, or web
    front-ends that interface to the real world, or cloud back-ends that
    assume that replication is a substitute for backups… He has always
    wanted a t-shirt that says: ‘There’s no way that could ever happen…’
    because he has heard it too many times in security workshops...

    \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sHn_PEFF0o&t=867s) \]
 
    Servers are the root of all web apps and sites, it’s the central
    point that your clients/customers will connect to and where you put
    your code.
    Many small and under resource companies that do there own hosting
    don’t normally put the time and investment in there hosting
    technology and this is where it starts to go wrong.
    This talk will discuss what some of the dangers are and what could
    happen if an attacker gets into your infrastructure, we will also
    talk about how some simple changes to the infrastructure can reduce
    the risk of being attacked.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Discussion about future of OWASP Suffolk**
 
    We will have open discussion about what we are doing, and what YOU
    expecting us to do.

#### Speakers

  - Edward Ogden has been in the IT industry for only 6 years and has
    learnt most of his skill on the job. He started his career as a web
    developer progressing on to operations side of the industry.
    Currently he is working for SETL Ltd as a DevOps engineer automating
    code deploys for client around the world. As a young child he was
    always interested in servers starting off by hosting gaming servers

  - **Windows Active Directory Security Lowlights - Barry Myles**
 
    Once an attacker is inside your organisation they very often will
    misuse Windows Active Directory for almost total compromise of every
    aspect of an organisation's computing infrastructure and the data it
    holds. This talk will describe how an attacker might do this, when
    they have done so in the past, the kinds of tools they would use,
    what common mistakes enable this, and how organisations could go
    about defending themselves both through changes in behaviour and
    changes to their setup.

#### Speakers

  - Barry Myles leads an internal penetration testing team at BT,
    although tries to stay away from very traditional views of pen
    testing as much as possible. After becoming somewhat bored and jaded
    with project management work in 2006 he decided the life on an
    attacker was a very much more fun, but perhaps less constructive way
    of life. He enjoys large scale scanning, reverse engineering,
    cryptography, hardware hacking and network protocols a bit too much.

  - **Understanding how to prevent Sensitive Data Exposure - Simon
    Greatrix** \[
    [](/www-pdf-archive/Owaspsuffollk-20190319.pdf )[PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/understanding-how-to-prevent-sensitive-data-exposure)
    \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1nNq3wt7Bg) \]

 
    Sensitive data is often the target of any attack, and its exposure
    has the greatest risk of long-term damage. OWASP and the PCI DSS
    provide many recommendations. The internet provides even more. These
    can be hard to understand, hard to implement, and contradictory. I
    will be sharing my understanding of how the cryptographic algorithms
    work and how they should best be used.

#### Speakers

  - Dr Simon Greatrix has been writing software since the late 70s and
    has worked as a security expert for e-commerce for nearly 20 years.
    He is currently working on SETL’s block chain product. Java has been
    his preferred programming language since 1996.
