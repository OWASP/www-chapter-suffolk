#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - Log4J - Past, Present, and Future**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

The log4j incident shocked the world back in December - but by implementing the proper protocols and tools early-on organizations can be better prepared moving forward. Logs, metrics, security, and metrics can be your secret weapon when it comes to the observability of your applications and software. But are you using all of your data sources to their full potential?

We’ll go over what organizations should keep in mind before, during, and post-security vulnerabilities (based on the log4j incident) when it comes to their monitoring tools and how powerful insights can be pulled to avoid delayed crisis management.

## Securing your Machine Learning solutions and protecting your models - Phil Basford ##

### [3rd May 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/285087125/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - Securing your Machine Learning solutions and protecting your models**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

Machine Learning is increasingly being used by companies as a disruptor or providing a USP. This means that Machine Learning models need to cope with being a critical part of solutions and if those solutions use PCI-DSS or PII then the models must be highly secure.

In addition, if a Machine Learning model is part of your USP then you will want to protect it. Also, the EU AI Regulation and UK AI Strategy means that AI is becoming increasingly regulated. This means you need able to prove what model made a prediction and why it made it by providing auditability and explainabilty.

In this talk we go over these issues and how to address them including using AWS and how to implement development best practices.

About the speaker:

Phil Basford is one of the Ipswich AWS User Group Leaders and contributes to the AWS Community by speaking at a number of summits, community days and meet-ups. He is a regular blogger, open-source contributor, and SME on Machine Learning, MLOps, DevOps, Containers and Serverless.

## Are We Secure? - Jeff Williams ##

### [26th April 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/284899658/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - Are we Secure?**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

We all trust software with the most important aspects of our life… but it’s a blind trust with virtually no justification. Actually, by almost any measure, application security has been failing for 20 years. Software is still riddled with vulnerabilities and gets attacked thousands of times a month – mostly undetected. Yet instead of trying different approaches, we mostly keep pushing the same futile and expensive practices harder.

In this talk, we’ll discuss why the underlying asymmetric information problem in the software market makes it impossible to make progress. And we’ll talk about how we can escape this trap, change the software market, and make software trustworthy for everyone.

About the speaker:

Jeff Williams - CTO of Contrast Security and OWASP Co-Founder

Jeff Williams is the co-founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as the Chair of the OWASP Board for 8 years and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI), OWASP Application Security Verification Standard(ASVS), XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, WebGoat and many other widely adopted free and open projects. Jeff is the co-founder and the CTO of Contrast Security. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown.

## All about Passwords ##

### [12th April 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/284467213/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **All about Passwords**
  - **Q&A**

Love them or hate them, passwords have become part of our daily life. We use them to sign into just about everything, from our devices to emails, social media, cloud services and digital banking. We have to remember different passwords for each site we need to log-in to, and we are forced to change them on occasion. It can be a lot to remember. Password Managers can help and 2FA or MFA can provide extra security. Yet despite all that, service providers can still be compromised and our carefully chosen passwords can end up somewhere on the darkweb being sold by the hundred thousand.

Making use of both slides and live demonstrations Martin and David will take you through a brief history of passwords, discussing password lengths and formats, password policies, guidelines and best practices, the storage and transmission of passwords, 2FA and MFA, and pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about passwords. All in under an hour.

Throughout the talk we will employ a Red vs Blue format with Martin playing Blue, discussing best practices and how to keep your logins protected. While David will be playing Red, discussing the techniques and tools employed by malicious actors in an attempt to secure access to your logins.

Disclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes.


## The best practices of working securely on AWS - Alex Kearns ##

### [29th March 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283317246/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **The talk - The best practices of working securely on AWS**
  - **Q&A**

The Talk:

Cloud has been around for a relatively long time now, yet there doesn’t seem to be a huge community of purely security focused individuals working with it. My theory is that this is down to cloud security appearing to be so different to what people are used to working with. Let’s try and bust that myth.

Join me for a bird’s eye view of the most important security concepts on AWS, what the best practices are around them as well as what AWS can do to help make life easier. I hope that this talk makes some of you more comfortable exploring AWS in the future.

About Alex:

Alex Kearns is a consultant at Inawisdom in Ipswich delivering data and AI/ML solutions on AWS for a variety of customers. Prior to this he has worked for an early stage startup and BT in a security focused role. He has a firm belief that security best practices should underpin all workloads, especially those in public clouds such as AWS.

## A Swiss Knife for API Security and Legal Risk Management - Dr Baljeet Malhotra ##

### [10th March 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283912021/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP updates**
  - **The talk - A Swiss Knife for API Security and Legal Risk Management**

The Talk:

Web applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some web APIs. You may be surprised to know that web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. In 2022, API abuses are predicted to be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks.

This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a “Swiss Knife” for reducing their API related risks. We’ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.

About Dr Baljeet Malhotra:

Dr Baljeet Malhotra is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first "API Composition Analysis" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security™, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC.

Hosting:

The talk is hosted by the OWASP Bristol chapter and is shared with OWASP Suffolk and OWASP Dorset and will be streamed live on YouTube. The streaming link will be made available closer to the event.

## OWASP Juice Shop demonstration ##

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP introduction and updates**
  - **Live demo of OWASP Juice Shop**

So you want to have a go at ethical hacking but you don't know where to start?

In under an hour Dave, Wojciech and Martin will walk you through installing, setting up and attacking OWASP Juice Shop from the comfort of your own home.

OWASP Juice Shop is a free insecure web application that you can install on your own computer. It's a popular security training tool riddled with security issues like SQL injection, XSS and security misconfigurations. Using gamification Juice Shop acts as an e-commerce website that you can legally attack on your own computer.

Juice Shop has built-in tutorials and comes with 100 challenges for you to find and exploit. With each challenge you solve your score increases on the scoreboard. But wait, where is the scoreboard? That's your very first challenge, to find the scoreboard hidden within the application. As you progress Juice Shop awards you points and displays your progress. Challenges are ranked by difficulty.

After walking you through installation and setup we will have an interactive session where we demo how to find the scoreboard and complete a few of the easy challenges.

## Discussion: Getting started in Ethical Hacking ##

### [18th January 2022 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/283069487/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **Welcome back & overview of what we have in store for 2022**
  - **OWASP updates**
  - **Open discussion on how to get started in Ethical Hacking**

Getting started in Ethical Hacking can seem daunting. There is so much information out there, so many websites, tools, YouTube videos, courses, etc etc. Where do you start? Do you have to do a course or be certified? Do I need to set up my own testing lab, and if so, what operating system and tools do I use? Is there a way to learn for free? So many questions. It can feel so overwhelming at times, enough to put you off.

The aim of this event is to offer an open discussion where we can all share tips, tricks, resources and suggestions around how to go about getting started in Ethical Hacking. Everything from how to make learning fun, recommended resources such as websites, podcasts, gamification sites (CTFs), tools, bug bounty platforms and tips and tricks on how to learn and remain focused.

This event will be open to members of OWASP Suffolk and other OWASP groups. This event will not be recorded.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Misconfigurations ##

### [2nd December 2021 (Virtual event)](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Suffolk-Chapter/events/282025399/)

Location: virtual

#### Agenda:

  - **OWASP updates**
  - **The talk**
  - **Open discussion**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) makes deploying cloud or container configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time. However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.

In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open-source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.

    As now everything is moving to cloud, all the applications are accessible from anywhere and everywhere. However, No one wants their private information to be compromised and openly available for the world. We have been taking so many precautions, however breaches continue to happen. How should we fix this?

    Organisations have been talking about Zero Trust lately and this has become a buzzword. The talk will explore Zero Trust beyond the buzzword and describe what exactly is Zero Trust and why it is so important to keep organisations safe. How can we implement or deploy Zero Trust in an organisation while keeping the current and future state of an organization in mind. What should be the business model to move any organisation towards Zero Trust Architecture and what all policies need to be implemented to achieve the same.

  - **how to prevent Dev from committing secrets and credentials into git repositories - Abhinav Sejpal** \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESGZ_Di7CtM) \]
    
    Sensitive information such as the AWS keys, access tokens, SSH keys etc. are often erroneously leaked via the public source code repositories due to accidental git commits. This can be avoided by using pre-commit hooks like “Talisman” which checks for sensitive information in the files before commits or push activity.

  - **Practical Threat Analysis – Martin Russ** \[
    [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/practical-threat-analysis-martin-russ)
    \]\[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lI4ZJom3u0) \]
 
     Martin Russ shows you how to actually do Threat Analysis using a
    simple spreadsheet as a guide. The key to successful threat analysis
    and modelling is to have a clear idea of how to get to the
    end-point, and not to get overwhelmed with how you are going to get
    there\! Having a simple guide makes this much easier, but there
    aren’t many examples out there - this turns to be one of those
    rare topics where Google searches don’t return much that is
    particularly useful. So we will be using a very straight-forward
    approach that isn’t scary or hard to understand, and which doesn’t
    require a brain the size of a planet. or the services of an
    expensive consultant\!

#### Speakers

  - Martin Russ passed the CISSP exam in just over four hours (you are
    allowed to take six\!), but has just lapsed and returned to the
    status of mere mortal. He worked in the Security Engineering
    department of a major US utility metering company for nearly ten
    years, and knows too much about hacking devices that measure, or web
    front-ends that interface to the real world, or cloud back-ends that
    assume that replication is a substitute for backups… He has always
    wanted a t-shirt that says: ‘There’s no way that could ever happen…’
    because he has heard it too many times in security workshops...

    Introduction to threat modeling what it is, why is needed and how to
    do it right. Why and how threat modeling should evolve to be ready
    for 21st century threats. We will discuss potential threats in each
    stage of SDLC, and how to approach them.

#### Speakers

  - Phil Ashby has over 30+ years experience in tech. He is currently
    working for an identity intelligence company, trying to evolve it

    \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sHn_PEFF0o&t=867s) \]
 
    Servers are the root of all web apps and sites, it’s the central
    point that your clients/customers will connect to and where you put
    your code.
    Many small and under resource companies that do there own hosting
    don’t normally put the time and investment in there hosting
    technology and this is where it starts to go wrong.
    This talk will discuss what some of the dangers are and what could
    happen if an attacker gets into your infrastructure, we will also
    talk about how some simple changes to the infrastructure can reduce
    the risk of being attacked.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Discussion about future of OWASP Suffolk**
 
    We will have open discussion about what we are doing, and what YOU
    expecting us to do.

#### Speakers

  - Edward Ogden has been in the IT industry for only 6 years and has
    learnt most of his skill on the job. He started his career as a web
    developer progressing on to operations side of the industry.
    Currently he is working for SETL Ltd as a DevOps engineer automating
    code deploys for client around the world. As a young child he was
    always interested in servers starting off by hosting gaming servers
    from his bedroom at the age of 14.

  - **Windows Active Directory Security Lowlights - Barry Myles**
 
    Once an attacker is inside your organisation they very often will
    misuse Windows Active Directory for almost total compromise of every
    aspect of an organisation's computing infrastructure and the data it
    holds. This talk will describe how an attacker might do this, when
    they have done so in the past, the kinds of tools they would use,
    what common mistakes enable this, and how organisations could go
    about defending themselves both through changes in behaviour and
    changes to their setup.

#### Speakers

  - Barry Myles leads an internal penetration testing team at BT,
    although tries to stay away from very traditional views of pen
    testing as much as possible. After becoming somewhat bored and jaded
    with project management work in 2006 he decided the life on an
    attacker was a very much more fun, but perhaps less constructive way
    of life. He enjoys large scale scanning, reverse engineering,
    cryptography, hardware hacking and network protocols a bit too much.

  - **Understanding how to prevent Sensitive Data Exposure - Simon
    Greatrix** \[
    [](/www-pdf-archive/Owaspsuffollk-20190319.pdf )[PDF](https://www.slideshare.net/owaspsuffolk/understanding-how-to-prevent-sensitive-data-exposure)
    \] \[ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1nNq3wt7Bg) \]

 
    Sensitive data is often the target of any attack, and its exposure
    has the greatest risk of long-term damage. OWASP and the PCI DSS
    provide many recommendations. The internet provides even more. These
    can be hard to understand, hard to implement, and contradictory. I
    will be sharing my understanding of how the cryptographic algorithms
    work and how they should best be used.

#### Speakers

  - Dr Simon Greatrix has been writing software since the late 70s and
    has worked as a security expert for e-commerce for nearly 20 years.
    He is currently working on SETL’s block chain product. Java has been
    his preferred programming language since 1996.
